> * For simplicity I decided to use **sqlite** in the public version so that it would be easier to get the things going.
> * I created three example users for you:
>> * login: admin / password: admin - the admin account.
>> * login: student_number_one / password: student#1 - example student #1.
>> * login: student_number_two / password: student#2 - example student #2.

## ‚ùóImportant‚ùó
* If you actually get your hands on this projects and think that it is usefull for learning / teaching english you can contact me and consult on the topic of adding tests, theory topics & just managing the website through the admin panel.
* I started this project when I was only beginning my coding journey and didn't know much about code maintanability, best practices & more. Therefore, lots of code in this project does need refactoring. I am not doing this because currently I am actively leveling up my JS & React skills and want to implement a similar project using next.js. Once I reimplement the project in next.js from scratch I will deploy it and replace the current django implementation with it.
1. Yes, I know that the "website\static\website\css\main.scss" file **must** be refactored.
2. Yes, I know that the same thing **must** be done to the "website\views.py" file in order to make code more modular and thus more maintainable for futre scaling.
3. & more...I guess you get the point.
